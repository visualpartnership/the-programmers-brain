# The Programmers Brain

Notes from The Programmer's brain by Felienne Hermans

## 1. Decoding your confusion while coding

- Code is a mental decoding process.
- Confussion involves cognitive processes.
- Confussion processes:
  - `Lack of knowledge`: understand what are you doing.
  - `Lack of information`: understand how this is happening. 
  - `Lack of processing power`: be able to execute the code in your brain.
- Cognitive processes associated:
  - Lack of knowledge: `LTM` Long term memory.
  - Lack of information: `STM` Short term memory. 
  - Lack of processing power: `Working memory`.
- The three cognitive processes work together when you're coding.
- LTM could be the knowlege and experience using a language intructions.
- STM could be the variables used to implement a piece of code.3

## 2. Speed reading for code

- "Programs must be writter for people to read and only incidentally for machines to execute" `Harold Abelson`.
- There is often a lot of focus on producing code.
- `STM` is limited (6 slots).
- **Chunking technique** to read code: read a piece of code for 3 minutes and try to remember it. Chunks help to structure your interpretation.
- Iconic memory: space to store sensory memory.
- Iconic memory can be procressed in the STM.
- **Iconic exercise:** look the code for a short time and the reflecting on what you have seen.
- Chunkeable code is about use conventions and patterns to help you to process code faster.
- When code contains comments, programmers will take more time to read it. (How do we read algorithms? Martha Crosby)
- **Beacons** are a piece of code contains certain data or approach.
- **Beacons** are a trigger for programmers to confirm or refute hyphotesis about the source. ðŸ˜²
